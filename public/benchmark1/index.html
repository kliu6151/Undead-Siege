      </div>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes a game called <em>Undead Siege</em>, which is
        designed to be a simple, top-down shooter, constructed and documented to
        help others learn to make similar games. The game will employ
        sprite-based animation, tile-based maps, collision detection, basic AI,
        top-down movement, and efficient memory management, as well as other
        basic techniques used in top-down games.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Technology</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Undead Siege</em> will be developed for the Windows platform using
        the Wolfie2D game engine, developed by Richard McKenna for rapid
        prototyping of 2D games. The underlying rendering technology will be
        DirectX. Audacity, Chiptone and Petaporon will be used for the creation
        of music and sound effects, and Adobe Photoshop and Piskell will be used
        for the creation of the game's artwork.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Backstory</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Undead Siege</em> is a game about a fractured person, a soul and
        body separated from each other, trying to find each other again. It’s a
        game about a person finding themself, and navigating the quite literal
        obstacles in their quest to find themselves again. You play as Gray, and
        you simultaneously control both their physical body in the real world
        and their soul in the Realm of Lost Souls. When Gray moves, so too does
        their soul, and various objectives and obstructions stand in your way on
        your quest to be whole once more. You will jump, fly, and crawl through
        puzzle after puzzle in your search for wholeness, and many obstacles
        will stand in your way as you navigate through the twin worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Gray’s body descends from Earth to the Realm of Souls, their soul
        attempts to fly out of it and escape so that they might finally be
        reunited once more.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Objective</h2>
      <p>
        The objective of <em>Undead Siege</em> is to refuel your helicopter, and
        get closer to the Hospital to save the world. This is accomplished by
        upgrading your weaponry and armor at different bases, and surviving the
        duration it takes to refuel your helicopter.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        The game will play as a top-down shooter, with the character(s) being
        able to move up, down, left, and right. At first, you, the player, must
        collect enough gasoline to refuel the helicopter. The zombies are
        constantly increasing in difficulty and count, as the night goes on, so
        you must try your best to survive the refueling. Zombies pull at the
        barriers, and you can rebuild them if you are close enough. You can
        upgrade your weapons and gear, and these upgrades save for future
        levels.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Controls</h2>
      <p>
        This game will be played using a keyboard, and the graphical user
        interface will be navigated using a mouse. Once started, use the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[A] - Move Left</li>
        <li>[D] - Move Right</li>
        <li>[←] - Move Left (same as [A])</li>
        <li>[→] - Move Right (same as [D])</li>
        <li>[E] - Interact with Environment</li>
        <li>[Left Click] - Shoot in Mouse Direction</li>
        <li>
          [Esc] - This pauses the game and presents a pop-up window to the
          player, asking them to continue when they are ready. If a game is not
          in progress, [Esc] does nothing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!--<p>
        In addition, game physics will vary slightly between the Body and the
        Soul, as the Soul will have a lower rate of descent whereas the Body
        will accelerate downwards at a regular acceleration, however, has the
        capability to double jump.
      </p>-->

      <h2 class="mt-4">Graphical User Interface</h2>
      <p>Here are the wireframes for the game.</p>

      <h5>Splash Screen</h5>
      <p>
        A simple screen will be presented, that just contains the game’s logo
        and one sentence of cool descriptive text. It will then fade out and
        reveal the Main Menu after a few seconds. Users will also be able to
        press [Esc] to skip this sequence and go straight to the main menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        The splash screen will contain a graphic that intrigues the player in
        the real game. It may also contain the game <a href="#logo">logo</a> .
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/SplashScreen.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game splash screen"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Main Menu Screen</h5>
      <p>
        The main menu will contain buttons to move to the Controls, Help, and
        Level Selection Screens. It will also have a button to allow the user to
        start a new game. Upon starting a new game, the screen will fade out and
        fade in to Level 1.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/MainMenu.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game main menu screen"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Controls Screen</h5>
      <p>
        This screen will display the controls of the game, in a similar manner
        to the controls setup listed above.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/ControlsScreen.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game controls screen"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Help Screen</h5>
      <p>
        This screen will list the developers of the game, as well as a link to
        contact us if the player has any questions or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>The user can scroll through the help screen</p>
      <img
        src="../images/HelpScreen.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game help screen"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Level Selection Screen</h5>
      <p>
        This screen will show the player which levels are currently unlocked,
        which they can then click on to play directly from the main menu. It
        will also show levels the user has not accessed yet, but these will not
        be clickable. Upon clicking an accessible level, the screen will fade
        out and fade in to the respective level.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/LevelSelection.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game level selection screen"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>In-Game GUI</h5>
      <p>
        These are the 2 In-Game GUI screens (gameplay screen & pause screen).
      </p>
      <h6>Gameplay Screen</h6>
      <img
        src="../images/GameScreen1.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game in-game gameplay screen 1"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      <img
        src="../images/GameScreen2.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game in-game gameplay screen 2"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h6>Pause Screen</h6>
      <img
        src="../images/GameScreenPause.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game in-game paused screen"
        class="wireframe"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h2 class="mt-4">Artwork</h2>
      <p>
        The artwork will all be done in pixel art, with a heavy theme on
        mysticality and uncanny valley-esque vibes in the Realm of Souls whereas
        the real world is mundane and normal. As a result, the Realm of Souls
        will be filled with bright and unnatural colors, strange shapes and
        other such obstacles whereas the mundane world will largely be composed
        of simple shapes, earthy, natural colors and normal hues. As the levels
        progress, the ‘real world’ would grow more and more uncanny and ethereal
        as the body descends through the levels of reality to reach the Realm of
        Souls, whereas the uncanny valley-esque Realm of Souls would grow more
        and more normal until they end up in the middle plane and meet each
        other at last, whereupon their sprite would unify and turn into a single
        being.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assets will need to be created for Gray’s body, Gray’s soul,
        obstructions, floors, walls, level backgrounds and more.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Sound Effects</h2>
      <p>Sound effects will be created for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Soul/Body movement and interactions with terrain objects</li>
        <li>Portals through the Realm of Souls, i.e. end-stage transfers</li>
        <li>Interactables such as levers, buttons and doors.</li>
        <li>Death for both the Soul/Body via spike traps and the like.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="mt-4">Music</h2>
      <p>Original music will be created for this game.</p>

      <hr />
