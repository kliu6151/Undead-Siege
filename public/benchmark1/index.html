        <hr />
      </div>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes a game called <em>Undead Siege</em>, which is
        designed to be a simple, top-down shooter, constructed and documented to
        help others learn to make similar games. The game will employ
        sprite-based animation, tile-based maps, collision detection, basic AI,
        top-down movement, and efficient memory management, as well as other
        basic techniques used in top-down games.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Technology</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Undead Siege</em> will be developed for the Windows platform using
        the Wolfie2D game engine, developed by Richard McKenna for rapid
        prototyping of 2D games. The underlying rendering technology will be
        DirectX. Audacity, Chiptone and Petaporon will be used for the creation
        of music and sound effects, and Adobe Photoshop and Piskell will be used
        for the creation of the game's artwork.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Backstory</h2>
      <p>
        In <em>Undead Siege</em>, you are humanity's last hope, entrusted with
        the ultimate mission: delivering the cure to a deadly virus that has
        turned the world into a zombie-infested wasteland. Navigate through the
        harsh environments, refuel your helicopter, and upgrade your arsenal,
        all while fending off relentless waves of the undead. Each level brings
        you closer to the final research facility, where you must gather fuel
        and attachment upgrades for your weapon during the day, and defend your
        helicopter and yourself from hordes of zombies at night. With the fate
        of humanity on the line, it's up to you to complete your mission, save
        the remaining survivors, and change the course of history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you ready to face the challenge and become the hero the world
        desperately needs? The <em>Undead Siege</em> awaits.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Your objective in <em>Undead Siege</em> is to deliver the cure to a
        deadly virus that has turned the world into a zombie-infested wasteland.
        As the last hope for humanity, you must navigate through harsh
        environments, gather fuel and attachment upgrades for your weapons, and
        fend off relentless waves of the undead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each level will bring you closer to the final research facility, where
        you must gather the necessary resources and defend your helicopter and
        yourself from hordes of zombies at night. However, time is not on your
        side. The zombies are constantly increasing in difficulty and count as
        the night progresses, and if they breach your defenses, it could mean
        the end of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your mission is to survive each night and advance to the next level, all
        while collecting resources and upgrading your arsenal. You must do
        everything in your power to keep yourself and the remaining survivors
        safe from the zombie onslaught.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fate of humanity rests on your shoulders. Are you ready to face the
        challenge and become the hero that the world desperately needs?
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Gameplay</h2>
      <p>
        Undead Siege is a challenging top-down shooter game where you must
        navigate through the zombie-infested wasteland, fending off relentless
        waves of undead and collecting resources to stay alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game features a day and night cycle, with each night bringing more
        difficult and numerous waves of zombies. During the day, you will need
        to gather fuel for your helicopter and attachment upgrades for your
        weapons while defending yourself from smaller hordes of zombies.
      </p>
      <p>
        At night, you must defend your helicopter and yourself from the
        onslaught of the undead. You can use the resources you gathered during
        the day to upgrade your arsenal, rebuild barriers, and fortify your
        defenses against the zombie hordes. If the zombies breach your defenses,
        it's game over.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can move your character up, down, left, and right using the W, A, S,
        and D keys. The space bar is used to interact with the environment, such
        as refueling your helicopter or rebuilding barriers. To attack, you will
        use the left mouse button. The game features pause functionality, which
        can be accessed by pressing the P key. When paused, a pop-up window will
        appear, allowing you to continue the game when ready.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Controls</h2>
      <p>
        This game will be played using a keyboard, and the graphical user
        interface will be navigated using a mouse. Once started, use the
        following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>[A] - Move Left</li>
        <li>[D] - Move Right</li>
        <li>[W] - Move Up</li>
        <li>[S] - Move Down</li>
        <li>[Space Bar] - Interact with Environment</li>
        <li>[Left Click] - Attack</li>
        <li>
          [P] - This pauses the game and presents a pop-up window to the player,
          asking them to continue when they are ready. If a game is not in
          progress, [Esc] does nothing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Graphical User Interface</h2>
      <p>Here are the wireframes for the game.</p>

      <h5>Splash Screen</h5>
      <p>
        A simple screen will be presented, that just contains the gameâ€™s logo
        and one sentence of cool descriptive text. It will then fade out and
        reveal the Main Menu after a few seconds. Users will also be able to
        press [Esc] to skip this sequence and go straight to the main menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        The splash screen will contain a graphic that intrigues the player in
        the real game. It may also contain the game <a href="#logo">logo</a> .
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/SplashScreen.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game splash screen"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Main Menu Screen</h5>
      <p>
        The main menu will contain buttons to move to the Controls, Help, and
        Level Selection Screens. It will also have a button to allow the user to
        start a new game. Upon starting a new game, the screen will fade out and
        fade in to Level 1.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/MainMenu.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game main menu screen"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Controls Screen</h5>
      <p>
        This screen will display the controls of the game, in a similar manner
        to the controls setup listed above.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/ControlScreen.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game controls screen"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Help Screen</h5>
      <p>
        This screen will list the developers of the game, as well as a link to
        contact us if the player has any questions or concerns.
      </p>
      <p>The user can scroll through the help screen</p>
      <img src="../images/HelpScreen.png" alt="Undead Siege game help screen" />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>Level Selection Screen</h5>
      <p>
        This screen will show the player which levels are currently unlocked,
        which they can then click on to play directly from the main menu. It
        will also show levels the user has not accessed yet, but these will not
        be clickable. Upon clicking an accessible level, the screen will fade
        out and fade in to the respective level.
      </p>
      <img
        src="../images/LevelSelection.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game level selection screen"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h5>In-Game GUI</h5>
      <p>
        These are the 3 In-Game GUI screens (Morning Gameplay Screen, Night
        Gameplay Screen, and Pause Screen).
      </p>
      <h6>Morning Gameplay Screen</h6>
      <img
        src="../images/GameScreen1.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game in-game gameplay screen 1"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h6>Night Gameplay Screen</h6>
      <img
        src="../images/GameScreen2.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game in-game gameplay screen 2"
      />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h6>Pause Screen</h6>
      <img
        src="../images/GameScreenPause.png"
        alt="Undead Siege game in-game paused screen"
      />
      <br />
      <br />

      <h2 class="mt-4">Artwork</h2>
      <p>
        The artwork in Undead Siege will be done in pixel art, with a heavy
        emphasis on the post-apocalyptic theme of the game. The game will
        feature dark, muted colors to reflect the bleakness of the world and the
        danger that the player faces. The environments will be highly detailed,
        with a focus on creating a sense of dread and unease as the player
        navigates through the zombie-infested wasteland.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assets will need to be created for the zombies, the player character,
        the environment, and various other obstacles and objects that the player
        will encounter throughout the game. Overall, the pixel art in Undead
        Siege will be highly immersive and will help to create a sense of
        tension and excitement as the player fights for survival in a world
        overrun by the undead.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Sound Effects</h2>
      <p>Sound effects will be created for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Gunfire: When the player fires their weapon, there will be a
          corresponding sound effect that reflects the type of weapon they're
          using.
        </li>
        <li>
          Zombie sounds: The zombies will make different sounds depending on
          their type and behavior, such as snarls, groans, and screams.
        </li>
        <li>
          Movement and interactions: There will be sound effects for the
          player's movements and interactions with terrain objects, such as
          footsteps, creaking doors, and the sound of rubble being moved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interactables: Sound effects will also be created for interactables
          such as levers, buttons, and doors opening and closing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Death: When the player dies, there will be a corresponding sound
          effect to signify the end of the game.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="mt-4">Music</h2>
      <p>Original music will be created for this game.</p>
